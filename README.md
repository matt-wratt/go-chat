## Go Chat

Don't use this.  This isn't example code.

Aims of this project are to teach me...

1. [Go](https://golang.org/)
2. [React-Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
3. Server side rendering of a React app

Things I would like to explore in future are...

1. Deploying to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
2. [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/)
3. [JSON Graph](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/documentation/jsongraph.html)
